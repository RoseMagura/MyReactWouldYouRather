# React Would You Rather ReadMe

## Introduction

    Welcome to my Would You Rather Redux + React project for the Udacity
    React Nanodegree. This is a fun website that allows users to post
    polls, vote, and compete with other users. 

## How to Run

    Just clone the git repository, run `npm install` and `npm start` or
    with yarn commands. The login page will automatically open in the
    default browser. 

    Note that the user must be logged in as one of the registered users
    in order to use the different features. If you try to manually 
    navigate to an endpoint, you will get an error message and be 
    redirected to the login page.

## Features

    Users can view their unanswered and answered questions after logging 
    in. From the main page, users can easily post new questions, vote on
    current questions, and view questions in more detail. The Nav is 
    visible on every page, and makes it easy to navigate to the different pages. There's also a leaderboard page, which shows the user rankings (how many questions created, how many answered, etc.).
    If you accidentally try to access a page that doesn't exist, you
    will see a helpful 404 error message. 

     Enjoy!
